// Stacks 

/*
    Objectives:-
    a)Define what a Stack is 
    b)Understand use cases for stack 
    c)Implement operations on a stack 
    d)Data Structure

    * What is a Stack ?
    -> A LIFO Data Structure
        the last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from 
        the sack 
    
    * How is it used ?
    -> Think about a stack of plates , or stack of markers ,or stack of 
        anything As you pile it up the last (or the topmost thing ) is what gets removed first 
    
    * Where the Stacks are used
        - Managing function invocations
        - Undo/Redo 
        - Routing (the history object)

    * Big O notations for stack 
        - Insertion O(1)
        - Removal O(1)
        - Searching O(N)
        - Access O(N)
    
    * RECAP 
        -Stack are a LIFO structure where the last value in is always first out
        -Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack) ,for operation like undo/redo and for 
         routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more
        - They are not a built in data structure is Javascript but are relatively simple to implement
