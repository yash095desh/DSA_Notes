MultiplePointers =
                    creating pointers or a value that corresponds to an inndex or position 
                    and move toward the biginning end or middle based on a certain condition
                    (very efficient for solving problem with minimal space complexity as well )

Question :- Write a function called sumZero which accepts  a sorted array of integers .The function 
            should find the first pair of value where the sum is  0 . return an array that includes 
            both values  that sum to zero or undefined if  a  pair doesn't exist 

            ex : 
            sumZero ([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]) //     [-3,3]
            sumZero ([-2,0,1,3]) //     undefined
            sumZero ([1,2,3]) //     undefined
