Divide And Conquer :-
                        This Pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process 
                        a set into smaller chunks and then  repeating a process with a subset of data 

                        * this pattern can tremendously decrese time complexity
                        self exp :-(
                           - This pattern is frequntly used in sorting algorithem reduces the time 
                            complexity O(n) to O(logn) 
                           - in this pattern we divide array in half and then checks the values lies in which part
                            (or check that is required value is greater than or less than mid value )
                            and thus using this repetedly we get the required value in much less time 
                           - helpful with dealing with large arrays 
                        )
