/*
    What is a Linked List ? 
    A data structure that contains a head ,tail , and length property 

    linked list consits of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer
    to another node or null

*/
/*
    Comparisons with Array 
    List : 
        - Do Not have indexes
        - Connected via nodes with a pointer
        - Random access is not allowed 

    Arrays 
        - Indexed in order ! 
        - Insertion and deletion can be expensive
        - Can quickly be accessed at a specific  index
